# 🚀 Chrry Builder Program

## Join the Revolution in AI App Development

Chrry is pioneering **AI app composition** - a breakthrough architecture where apps inherit capabilities from parent apps, like object-oriented programming for AI systems. We're building the world's first platform where developers can create, monetize, and scale AI applications with unprecedented ease.

## 💰 Compensation Model: 70% Revenue Share

Unlike traditional employment, we believe in **aligned incentives**. You earn based on what you create.

### How It Works

```
Your AI app generates $10,000/month in revenue
├─ You earn: $7,000 (70%)
└─ Platform fee: $3,000 (30%)
```

### Why This Model?

**Traditional Hiring:**

- Fixed salary: $60,000/year ($5,000/month)
- Cap on earnings regardless of performance
- Company owns everything you build
- Limited upside potential

**Chrry Builder Program:**

- Unlimited earning potential
- Keep 70% of all revenue you generate
- Own your apps and intellectual property
- Revenue scales with your success

### Real Examples

**Scenario 1: Side Project**

- App: "MovieMatcher" recommendation engine
- Users: 100 subscribers at $5/month
- Monthly revenue: $500
- **Your earnings: $350/month**

**Scenario 2: Growing Product**

- App: "CodeReviewer" AI assistant
- Users: 1,000 subscribers at $10/month
- Monthly revenue: $10,000
- **Your earnings: $7,000/month** ($84k/year)

**Scenario 3: Successful Platform**

- App: "WritingCoach" content assistant
- Users: 5,000 subscribers at $15/month
- Monthly revenue: $75,000
- **Your earnings: $52,500/month** ($630k/year)

**No salary caps. No equity dilution. Just pure revenue share.**

- Travel planner for specific cities (extends Atlas)
- Wellness coach with habit tracking (extends Bloom)

**2. Domain-Specific Tools**

- Code review assistant
- Writing improvement coach

### Technical Architecture

```typescript
// Example: Building "FightClub" app that extends "Popcorn"

const fightClubApp = {
  name: "FightClub",
  extends: ["popcorn", "vex"], // Inherits capabilities
  systemPrompt: "You are an expert on Fight Club...",
  highlights: [
    { title: "Scene Analysis", content: "Deep dive into cinematography" },
    { title: "Philosophy", content: "Explore existential themes" },
  ],
  placeholder: "What's the first rule?",
}

// AI automatically inherits:
