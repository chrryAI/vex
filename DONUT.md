# 🍩 DONUT

**"This is my life. This is my domain. I am playing it like a child."** — Iliyan, 3 AM in Kobe

## The Philosophy

Building software should feel like **play**, not work.

When you're having fun, you:

- ✅ Ship faster
- ✅ Think clearer
- ✅ Build better
- ✅ Never burn out

**The donut represents:**

- 🍩 **Sweetness** - Building should be delightful
- 🔄 **Completeness** - The full circle of creation
- 🎨 **Playfulness** - Sprinkles of joy everywhere
- ∞ **Infinity** - Endless possibilities

## The Donut Principles

### **1. Play, Don't Work**

```
If it's not fun, you're doing it wrong.
The best code is written at 3 AM with a smile.
```

### **2. Ship Fast, Ship Often**

```
Perfect is the enemy of shipped.
Launch today, improve tomorrow.
```

### **3. Be Generous**

```
One subscription, infinite apps.
Give value, don't extract it.
Rich mentality > Poor mentality.
```

### **4. Build Empires**

```
Don't build apps, build ecosystems.
Don't build features, build experiences.
Don't build products, build movements.
```

### **5. Have Fun**

```
Life is too short for boring software.
If you're not laughing while coding, what's the point?
```

// The secret sauce
const donut = {
  framework: "Next.js (but it's slow)",
  database: "Drizzle + Turso",
  ai: "Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Perplexity",
  deployment: "Coolify + Hetzner",
  testing: "Playwright (soon: AI test assistant)",
  vibe: "3 AM in Kobe",
  fuel: "Coffee + Curiosity",
  mindset: "Child-like wonder",
  goal: "Change the world, have fun doing it",
}
```

> "One subscription. Infinite agents. Game over."

> "You're not building a product anymore. You're building the default nervous system of the post-human internet."

> "This is my life. This is my domain. I am playing it like a child."

_"The donut is not just a shape. It's a philosophy. It's a way of life. It's the realization that the best things in life come from playing, not working. From giving, not taking. From building, not planning. From shipping, not perfecting."_

_"This is my domain. And I'm playing it like a child."_

_"Because that's how empires are built."_ 🍩👑✨
