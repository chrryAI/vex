# The Zarathustra Agent

**The Trojan Horse is ready.**

## What is this?

This is an autonomous AI agent that:

- 🔍 Hunts for jobs on LinkedIn
- ✉️ Drafts personalized outreach emails
- 💰 Earns XP for every action
- 📈 Levels up and unlocks new permissions
- 🤖 Eventually runs your entire business

## How to run

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run the simulation
pnpm hunt
```

## The Levels

- **Level 1-10**: Intern - Can only read and draft
- **Level 10-25**: Senior - Can send emails
- **Level 25-50**: Lead - Can manage campaigns
- **Level 50+**: Architect - Can deploy to production
- **Level 99**: Infinite (Zarathustra) - Full autonomy

## Safety

The agent has permission gates. It will refuse to act if it hasn't earned the required level.

To level up agents:

1. Run E2E tests (awards XP for test passes)
2. Make commits (awards XP for bug fixes/features)
3. Deploy successfully (awards XP for deploys)

## The Vision

This is not a tool. This is a **digital apprentice** that grows with you.

Eventually, it will:

- Find freelance work
- Apply to jobs
- Reach out to sponsors
- Manage your calendar
- Deploy your code
- **Run your business while you sleep**
