**storage:** Required to save your Pomodoro timer settings (work/break durations), completed session history, task associations, and optional mood logs (emotional state during work sessions) locally in your browser. This allows the extension to remember your preferences and track your productivity patterns over time. No medical or health data is collected.

**sidePanel:** Enables the Pomodoro timer to display in your browser's sidebar panel, allowing you to keep the timer visible while working on other tabs without interrupting your workflow. Also provides seamless user authentication and subscription management through the sidebar interface.

**tabs:** Used to detect which tab you're working in when a Pomodoro session is active, enabling optional task association (e.g., "worked on GitHub for 25 minutes"). This helps you understand where your focused time is spent.

**contextMenus:** Adds right-click menu options interact with the AI assistant (e.g., ask questions about selected text, get task suggestions). Provides convenient access to timer and chat features without opening the full extension interface.

**Host Permissions (focus.chrry.ai, chrry.dev):** Required to authenticate users, manage subscription information, and load UI assets (images, icons, styles) from the Focus domain. This permission enables seamless login, syncing timer data across devices, and displaying the extension interface without bundling all resources locally.
