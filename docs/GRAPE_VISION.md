# 🍇 Grape Vision: Reclaiming Attention in the Age of Ad Overload

**Status:** Vision Document  
**License:** AGPL-3.0  
**Project:** Open Source  
**Mission:** Make attention pollution visible and give users control over their attention economy

---

## Executive Summary

Grape is a two-part open-source solution to the attention economy crisis:

1. **Grape Glasses** - AI-powered smart glasses that track and quantify ad exposure in real-time
2. **Grape Platform** - Consent-based advertising platform where users get paid for their attention

Together, they create a complete ecosystem that makes invisible attention theft visible, then provides an ethical alternative where users control when they see ads and get compensated for their time.

**The Problem:** Average person sees 4,000-10,000 ads per day. Nobody tracks this. Nobody gets paid. Attention is stolen, not earned.

**The Solution:** Grape makes ad exposure visible (glasses) and offers a better model (platform) where users consent to ads and get paid directly.

## Part 2: Grape Platform - Consent-Based Advertising

### What Is Grape Platform?

A revolutionary advertising model built into Vex where users **choose** when to see ads and get **paid directly** for their attention.

### How It Works

#### User Flow

```
1. User clicks 🍇 emoji in Vex
   → "I consent to see ads right now"

2. User selects interests
   → Tech, Travel, Fashion, Food, etc.

3. Grape shows 5-10 curated ads
   → Video, interactive, product demos
   → 2-3 minutes total

4. User engages with ads
   → Watch, click, interact

5. User gets paid
   → $1.50-$2.00 per session
   → Instant to Grape Wallet
   → Cash out anytime
```

#### Advertiser Flow

```
1. Create campaign
   → Set budget, target audience, payout

2. Upload ad content
   → Video, interactive, product page

3. Set targeting
   → Demographics, interests, location

4. Launch campaign
   → Grape matches to relevant users

5. Track performance
   → Real-time analytics, ROI tracking
```

### Economics

#### Payment Model

```
Advertiser pays: $2.00 per engaged view
User receives:   $1.70 (85%)
Grape takes:     $0.30 (15%)

Why advertisers pay more:
- Voluntary attention = 10x higher engagement
- Self-selected targeting = better conversion
- No ad fraud = verified real users
- Quality over quantity
```

#### User Earnings Potential

```
Casual (10 sessions/month):  $15-20/month
Active (daily sessions):     $50-60/month
Power (multiple daily):      $150-200/month

Annual potential:
- Casual: $180-240/year
- Active: $600-720/year
- Power: $1,800-2,400/year
```

#### Platform Revenue

```
At 100k users (10 sessions/month):
- 1M ad views/month
- $300k platform revenue/month
- $3.6M/year

At 1M users:
- 10M ad views/month
- $3M platform revenue/month
- $36M/year
```

### Key Features

#### 1. **Smart Matching Algorithm**

```typescript
function matchAdsToUser(user, availableAds) {
  return availableAds
    .map((ad) => ({
      ad,
      score: calculateRelevance({
        userInterests: user.interests,
        adCategory: ad.category,
        userHistory: user.pastEngagement,
        adQuality: ad.qualityScore,
        payout: ad.payoutPerView,
        timing: user.currentContext,
      }),
    }))
    .sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score)
    .slice(0, 10)
}
```

## The Complete Ecosystem: Glasses + Platform

### The Virtuous Cycle

```
1. User wears Grape Glasses
   → Tracks ad exposure: "You saw 247 ads today"
   → CPI score: 78/100 (high pollution)

2. User sees the data
   → "Holy shit, I'm being bombarded"
   → "And I'm not getting paid for any of it"

3. User opens Grape Platform in Vex
   → "Want to get PAID for your attention instead?"
   → Click 🍇 emoji

4. User sees 5 curated ads
   → Earns $1.70 in 3 minutes
   → High-quality, relevant ads

5. User realizes
   → "I saw 247 ads for free today"
   → "Or I can see 5 ads and earn $1.70"
   → "I'll take the $1.70"

6. Behavior change
   → Blocks all involuntary ads
   → Only sees ads through Grape
   → Gets paid for attention
   → CPI drops to 15/100

7. Network effect
   → User shares with friends
   → "I made $50 this month from ads"
   → Friends join Grape
   → Movement grows
```

### Data Integration

```typescript
// Glasses track involuntary ads
const involuntaryAds = {
  today: 247,
  thisWeek: 1456,
  thisMonth: 6234,
  earnings: 0, // $0 for involuntary ads
  cpi: 78,
}

// Platform tracks voluntary ads
const voluntaryAds = {
  today: 5,
  thisWeek: 35,
  thisMonth: 150,
  earnings: 255, // $255 for voluntary ads
  cpi: 15,
}

// Combined insights
const insights = {
  message:
    "You saw 247 involuntary ads today (CPI: 78) but earned $0. You saw 5 voluntary ads and earned $8.50. Voluntary ads are 49x more efficient for your time.",
  recommendation:
    "Block involuntary ads and increase Grape sessions to 2/day to earn $100/month while reducing CPI to <20.",
}
```

**Q: What targeting options exist?**
A: Users self-select interests. You can target by: interests, demographics, location, time of day, device type. No invasive tracking needed.
