## 2025-05-21 - CSRF Protection and SameSite Cookie Behavior

**Context:** Subdomains of the same registrable domain (e.g., `chrry.ai` and `api.chrry.ai`) are considered **same-site** by browsers. Therefore, `SameSite=Lax` cookies are sent between these subdomains and provide built-in CSRF protection. `SameSite=None` is only required for true **cross-site** scenarios (e.g., `example.com` ↔ `api.chrry.ai`).

**Vulnerability:** If the application were to use `SameSite=None` cookies unnecessarily, it would expose the API to CSRF attacks via cross-site forms (POST/multipart) from any origin, bypassing browser CSRF protections.

**Learning:**

- **Same-site (subdomains):** `chrry.ai` ↔ `api.chrry.ai` → Use `SameSite=Lax` (default protection)
- **Cross-site (different domains):** `example.com` ↔ `api.chrry.ai` → Requires `SameSite=None` + strict Origin/Referer validation

**Prevention:** When `SameSite=None` is necessary for cross-site integrations, implement CSRF middleware for state-changing methods (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) with the following validation flow:

1. **If `Origin` header is present:** Validate against trusted origins list. Reject if untrusted.
2. **If `Origin` is missing, check `Referer` header:** Validate against trusted origins. Reject if untrusted.
3. **If neither header is present:** Either reject the request (strict mode) or require a valid CSRF token (token-based fallback).

**Trusted Origins:** Maintain an allowlist of trusted domains (e.g., `*.chrry.ai`, `*.chrry.dev`, `*.chrry.store`) and validate that the parsed hostname from `Origin` or `Referer` matches the trusted patterns.

**Note:** For same-site subdomain communication with `SameSite=Lax`, this middleware is not required as browsers provide built-in CSRF protection. This defense-in-depth approach is specifically for `SameSite=None` scenarios where cross-site requests are intentionally allowed.

## 2025-05-23 - OAuth State Parameter Validation

**Vulnerability:** The Google OAuth flow was generating a `state` parameter but failed to verify it upon callback, exposing the application to Login CSRF attacks. An attacker could potentially log a victim into the attacker's account.

**Learning:** Generating a `state` parameter is insufficient if it is not cryptographically bound to the user's session (e.g., via a secure cookie) and verified upon return.

**Prevention:** Always implement the `state` parameter check in OAuth flows:
1. Generate a random state.
2. Store it in a secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookie.
3. Pass it to the OAuth provider.
4. On callback, compare the returned `state` with the cookie value.
5. Reject if they don't match.
6. Clear the cookie after verification.
